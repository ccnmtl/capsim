		<h2>Background</h2>
		
		<p>
		The Public Health Capstone Simulation is a web-based learning environment for practicing the application of systems thinking to public health policy and intervention decision-making. The program takes participants through a series of systems thinking exercises that leads to the use of an agent-based simulation for testing relationship theories, and then applying findings to support an intervention proposal for addressing a public health challenge provided by the system. A successful intervention proposal requires the application of a systems perspective to approaching complex problems. The proposal consists of an evidence-based rationale that includes data generated by participant use of the simulation model, and requires the participant to back their intervention proposal with data coming from actual public health research.
